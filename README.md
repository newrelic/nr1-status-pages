# Status Page

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-status-pages/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-status-pages?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-status-pages/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-status-pages)

## Usage

Status Page is a [Statuspage.io](https://www.statuspage.io)-inspired application that allows you to easily configure the most important key dependencies to your business in one color-coded view.

Status Page also displays an event stream of previous incidents and outages, along with updates for easy follow-along.

Choose an existing supported service like Jira, or add a new service.

Example NRQL query:

```sql
FROM AlertViolationsSample SELECT timestamp as EventTimeStamp, priority as EventStatus, condition_name as EventName, entity.name LIMIT 50
```

```sql
SELECT timestamp as EventTimeStamp, priority as EventStatus, condition_name as EventName, entity.name FROM AlertViolationsSample LIMIT 50
```

### RSS feed

It is possible to choose RSS feed as a provider for status pages.

### CORS configuration

It is possible to configure CORS proxy when creating new service. CORS proxy address must contain `{url}` placeholder that will be replaced with provided hostname.

Example: `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/{url}`
